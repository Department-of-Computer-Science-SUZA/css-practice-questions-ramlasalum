  <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically the Ethiopian plateau and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean. Coffea is now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less sophisticated but stronger and more disease-resistant robusta. The coffee plant is a perennial shrub or small tree, with evergreen leaves, white blossoms that resemble jasmine, and red or purple fruit containing two seedsCoffee plants are cultivated in certain regions of the world, called coffee belts. Most coffee is grown in developing countries, and it is one of their most important export crops. Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it is estimated that over 2.25 billion cups are consumed each day.

    Coffee beans are roasted, then ground and brewed with hot water to produce a beverage known as coffee. Coffee can be served hot or cold, and it can be enjoyed black or with milk, cream, or sugar. Coffee has a stimulating effect on humans primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most profitable international commodities.</p>
